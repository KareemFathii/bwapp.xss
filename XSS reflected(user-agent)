There is no input field can i inject a script 
but displays Your User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
i thought to open inspect to found anything but was useless 
i decided to open burpsuit to intercept and see the http request 
there is input field in the request named user-agent and i delete the Mozilla/5.0.........
and write my script and forwarded the request 
i wrote : <script>alert("xss")</script> 
it works and excute the alert .
