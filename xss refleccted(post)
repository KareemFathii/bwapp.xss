First i tried to input any thing in the input field to see the result 

it prints the name which i written in the input field 

then i checked the inspect to see where it written

and try to inject this script

<script> alert"xss" </script> in 1 input field from the 2 and it gives me error that i must fill the 2 input fields 

so i decided to fill in the first 1 < script > alert() and in the second one </script>

and it works and try to inject another payloads .
