and it prints a thankful message only there is no input field to use it in the injection 
and i started to see the cookies in the inspect and found that in the cookie there is a movie_genre: type which i choose 
i tried to inject a different type in the url like comedy and it work and stored in the cookies 
and i decided to open burp suit to track and analyze the http request , insert and store in cookie
and i changed the movie type .
